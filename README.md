## üîç What is Tamarin Prover?

The **Tamarin Prover** is a formal verification tool for cryptographic protocols. It allows researchers and developers to:
- Analyze the security of protocols in the presence of adversaries.
- Verify properties like secrecy, authentication, and integrity.
- Explore both honest and adversarial scenarios in protocol interactions.
